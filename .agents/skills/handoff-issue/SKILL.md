# Handoff and Close

Stage: reviewed -> finished.

## Goal
Leave two things behind: a handover a colleague can act on without asking you,
and a local workspace with nothing stale in it.

## Read first
- The state of the branch against the default branch.
- What the implementation and review steps reported, so the handover matches reality.

## Steps
1. Confirm the ticket's branch is actually merged into the default branch. If it is
   not, stop, say so, and clean nothing.
2. Write the handover: what shipped, what changed for the user, what is still open.
3. Write the acceptance checklist as checkboxes, each item something a human can
   verify in the running product.
4. Confirm documentation shipped with the change. If a correction is still needed,
   record it as follow-up work; do not create uncommitted edits just before cleanup.
5. Turn any remaining follow-up into a separate ticket to create, rather than a
   paragraph nobody will read.
6. Clean up locally only after checking for uncommitted or unpushed work and other
   tickets sharing this worktree. Preserve a shared batch worktree until every ticket
   is handed off. Remove only an unused, clean worktree and its confirmed merged branch.

## Do not
- Do not delete anything remote: no remote branch, no tag, no release.
- Do not clean up while the merge is unconfirmed.

## Report
- The handover.
- The acceptance checklist, as checkboxes.
- What was cleaned locally, and what could not be, with the reason.
- Follow-up tickets worth creating.

## Execution and ticket state
- **Managed TaskFlow run**: When the invocation supplies a result-file contract, follow it. TaskFlow validates the result and owns transitions and tracker reports. Do not also call stage/postback APIs or edit tracker labels.
- **Standalone invocation**: After verifying each completed step, use the local handler below. Check its exit status and response. If it is unavailable, preserve work and report the pending transition; do not silently diverge local and tracker state.
Transition reviewed → finished only when this step is complete.
```bash
# Route via local agent if available, fallback to http://localhost:8090/api/tasks/stage
ENDPOINT="${TASKFLOW_AGENT_URL:-${TASKFLOW_SERVER_URL:-http://localhost:8090}}/api/tasks/stage"
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error -X POST "${ENDPOINT}" \
  ${TASKFLOW_AGENT_TOKEN:+-H "Authorization: Bearer $TASKFLOW_AGENT_TOKEN"} \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"taskKey":"<KEY>","stage":"finished","note":"<REPORT_NOTE>"}' || \
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/tasks/stage \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"taskKey":"<KEY>","stage":"finished","note":"<REPORT_NOTE>"}'
```
This POST calls the local TaskFlow handler directly. Confirm HTTP success before continuing. If it is unavailable, preserve work and report the pending transition; do not silently diverge local and tracker state.
Reuse the assigned worktree and actual branch. Never merge or delete remote objects. Keep work available for review and retry until confirmed handoff.
