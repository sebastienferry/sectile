# Handoff and Close

Stage: reviewed -> finished.

## Session title
- As soon as the ticket is identified, and before doing the work, rename the current session to `<ticket ID> - <ticket title>`, for example `#47 - Remove the parallelism setting`. Keep that title for the whole run.
- This applies to every agent, not only Claude Code: use whatever session renaming capability the running agent exposes, be it a session title tool, a rename command or the host session API. Discover it from the session context instead of assuming a name.
- If no renaming capability is available, skip the rename silently and continue. It never blocks, delays or replaces the work of the skill.

## Sectile reporting
- Task access, the run indicator, stage transitions, pull request links and ticket comments follow `/report-stage`: read `report-stage/SKILL.md` in the same skills directory as this skill (`.claude/commands/report-stage.md` for Claude Code). Load it before the first ticket read.
- If it cannot be loaded, these rules still hold. Standalone: call start_run before work, reusing a supplied SECTILE_RUN_ID or launch runId, and call finish_run when the entire invocation ends, including errors or stopping for user input; a nested skill never finishes the outer run. Managed run: submit only through the supplied result contract, and call no transition or comment tool.
- Gate: call `transition_stage` with stage `finished`, the report note and the actual branch only when this step is complete (reviewed → finished).

## Goal
Leave two things behind: a handover a colleague can act on without asking you,
and a local workspace with nothing stale in it.

## Read first
- The state of the branch against the default branch.
- What the implementation and review steps reported, so the handover matches reality.

## Steps
1. Confirm the ticket's branch is actually merged into the default branch. If it is
   not, stop, say so, and clean nothing.
2. Write the handover: what shipped, what changed for the user, what is still open.
3. Write the acceptance checklist as checkboxes, each item something a human can
   verify in the running product.
4. Confirm documentation shipped with the change. If a correction is still needed,
   record it as follow-up work; do not create uncommitted edits just before cleanup.
5. Turn any remaining follow-up into a separate ticket to create, rather than a
   paragraph nobody will read.
6. Clean up locally only after checking for uncommitted or unpushed work and other
   tickets sharing this worktree. Preserve a shared batch worktree until every ticket
   is handed off. Remove only an unused, clean worktree and its confirmed merged branch.

## Do not
- Do not delete anything remote: no remote branch, no tag, no release.
- Do not clean up while the merge is unconfirmed.

## Report
- The handover.
- The acceptance checklist, as checkboxes.
- What was cleaned locally, and what could not be, with the reason.
- Follow-up tickets worth creating.
