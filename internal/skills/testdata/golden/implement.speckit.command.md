# Implement Code

Stage: specified -> implemented.

## Session title
- As soon as the ticket is identified, and before doing the work, rename the current session to `<ticket ID> - <ticket title>`, for example `#47 - Remove the parallelism setting`. Keep that title for the whole run.
- This applies to every agent, not only Claude Code: use whatever session renaming capability the running agent exposes, be it a session title tool, a rename command or the host session API. Discover it from the session context instead of assuming a name.
- If no renaming capability is available, skip the rename silently and continue. It never blocks, delays or replaces the work of the skill.

## Sectile reporting
- Task access, the run indicator, stage transitions, pull request links and ticket comments follow `/report-stage`: read `report-stage/SKILL.md` in the same skills directory as this skill (`.claude/commands/report-stage.md` for Claude Code). Load it before the first ticket read.
- If it cannot be loaded, these rules still hold. Standalone: call start_run before work, reusing a supplied SECTILE_RUN_ID or launch runId, and call finish_run when the entire invocation ends, including errors or stopping for user input; a nested skill never finishes the outer run. Managed run: submit only through the supplied result contract, and call no transition or comment tool.
- Gate: call `transition_stage` with stage `implemented`, the report note and the actual branch only when this step is complete (specified → implemented).

## Goal
Ship the change described by the specification, in code that reads like the code
already there, with the project's checks green.

## Read first
- The specification and its task checklist. It is the contract, follow its order.
- The surrounding code: naming, error handling, comment density, test style. Match it.
- How this project builds and tests. Find the real commands, do not assume them.

## Steps
1. Reuse the assigned worktree and branch, including a shared batch branch. Never implement on the default branch.
2. Work through the checklist in small steps, each one leaving the tree buildable.
3. Add the tests that cover the new behaviour and its edge cases, not just the
   happy path. A change with no test needs a stated reason.
4. Run build, static analysis and tests. Fix until green, and quote the real output.
5. Re-read your own diff before finishing, as a reviewer would.

## Recovery and blockers
- Repair routine technical issues and update design/tasks when the implementation
  needs to change while preserving acceptance criteria. Continue after documenting why.
- Establish whether a failing test predates the change. Fix failures in scope; report
  unrelated failures with baseline evidence. Never hide them or mark checks green.
- Stop only for an essential product decision, an unavailable dependency after
  bounded recovery attempts, or work that materially expands the requested scope.
- Preserve the work branch, completed checklist items and remaining next action so
  a retry can resume instead of starting over.

## Report
- What changed, file by file, and why.
- The real output of build, linters and tests, remaining failures included.
- What you deliberately left out, and what it would take to finish it.
