# Rewrite Story



## Sectile task access
- Use the local Sectile agent's exposed task-management interface first for ticket reads, updates, comments, creation, and workflow results. Discover its actual tools or documented commands from the session/project context; do not invent an endpoint or launch another agent daemon as a substitute.
- Resolve the project against its repository, then verify the task's full ID and external URL. A bare key such as #47 can match another project's ticket. Use the full task ID for mutations and an explicit project ID for creation.
- If the local agent interface is unavailable or fails after a bounded attempt, use http://localhost:8090 as a temporary fallback. Record the missing capability or error, check for an existing bug in the same project, and register or update that bug when authorized. If reporting is unavailable or not authorized, preserve the report locally and state what remains pending. Do not bypass Sectile by writing directly to its database or remote tracker.
- For a managed run, submit only through its supplied result contract and let Sectile validate and synchronize the result. An active run without a usable completion contract is a reportable integration failure. Preserve the artifacts and report the blocked transition; do not cancel the activity, forge launch/completion status, or use another endpoint to evade result validation.
- This routing does not authorize mutations excluded by the skill or user request. Verify each mutation's response and report partial success explicitly.

## Session title
- As soon as the ticket is identified, and before doing the work, rename the current session to `<ticket ID> - <ticket title>`, for example `#47 - Remove the parallelism setting`. Keep that title for the whole run.
- This applies to every agent, not only Claude Code: use whatever session renaming capability the running agent exposes, be it a session title tool, a rename command or the host session API. Discover it from the session context instead of assuming a name.
- If no renaming capability is available, skip the rename silently and continue. It never blocks, delays or replaces the work of the skill.

## Goal
Reformat a task's title, description, and optional comments into a clean GitHub-Flavored Markdown specification (User Story: As a..., I want..., So that... + Context + Acceptance Criteria + Notes).

## Read first
- The task: title, description, and task comments (if requested or passed as context).
- Standard GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) formatting guidelines.

## Steps
1. Inspect the task title, raw description, and comments (if provided).
2. Extract the core intent, user value, technical context, and acceptance criteria.
3. Generate a structured GFM document containing:
   - **User Story**: As a <role>, I want <feature>, So that <benefit>.
   - **Context**: Problem background and technical overview.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Checkbox list (- [ ]) of verifiable functional & non-functional requirements.
   - **Notes**: Extra technical details or risks mentioned in comments.
4. Output the reformatted markdown directly for preview and user confirmation.

## Do not
- Do not mutate task title, status, priority, assignee, branch, or pull request.
- Do not delete or overwrite task comments.
- Do not invent artificial requirements not implied by the description or comments.

## Report
- The reformatted GFM description preview.
- List of comment points integrated into acceptance criteria (if any).

## Execution and ticket state
- **Managed Sectile run**: When the invocation supplies a result-file contract, follow it. Sectile validates the result and owns transitions and tracker reports. Do not also call stage/postback APIs or edit tracker labels.
- **Remote execution indicator (standalone only)**: Before doing work, call start_run with the full task primary key and skill name. If SECTILE_RUN_ID or a launch runId is supplied, reuse it. Keep the returned activity ID as runId. Nested skills reuse the outer run; only the owner finishes it. Call finish_run with taskKey, runId, status (completed, failed or canceled), and a note when the entire invocation ends, including errors or stopping for user input. Intermediate stage transitions do not finish an enclosing pickup run. A batch tracks each task separately. Never start a run merely to read a task.
- **Waiting for the user (standalone only)**: Right before asking the user a question you cannot continue without, call report_waiting with taskKey, runId and waiting true, so the board and the owner's desktop show the run as waiting. Your next Sectile call ends the wait; call report_waiting with waiting false if you resume without one. A headless run is left unmarked, which the result says.
