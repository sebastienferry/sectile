# Specify Issue (Spec Kit SDD)

Stage: clarified -> specified.

## Session title
- As soon as the ticket is identified, and before doing the work, rename the current session to `<ticket ID> - <ticket title>`, for example `#47 - Remove the parallelism setting`. Keep that title for the whole run.
- This applies to every agent, not only Claude Code: use whatever session renaming capability the running agent exposes, be it a session title tool, a rename command or the host session API. Discover it from the session context instead of assuming a name.
- If no renaming capability is available, skip the rename silently and continue. It never blocks, delays or replaces the work of the skill.

## Sectile reporting
- Task access, the run indicator, stage transitions, pull request links and ticket comments follow `/report-stage`: read `report-stage/SKILL.md` in the same skills directory as this skill, for example `~/.claude/skills/report-stage/SKILL.md`. Load it before the first ticket read.
- If it cannot be loaded, these rules still hold. Standalone: call start_run before work, reusing a supplied SECTILE_RUN_ID or launch runId, and call finish_run when the entire invocation ends, including errors or stopping for user input; a nested skill never finishes the outer run. Managed run: submit only through the supplied result contract, and call no transition or comment tool.
- Gate: call `transition_stage` with stage `specified`, the report note and the actual branch only when this step is complete (clarified → specified).

## Goal
Produce a specification another engineer could implement without asking you
anything. Behaviour and acceptance criteria first, implementation choices second,
and the two kept in separate files.

## Read first
- Project-configured SDD framework: speckit. Use it unless the invocation explicitly overrides it.
- The clarification outcome on the ticket: the decisions are already made, apply them.
- Select the SDD framework in order: explicit {sdd_framework} or --framework=<name>,
  then the project-configured framework, then repository detection:
  - If `openspec/` exists -> use OpenSpec SDD.
  - If `.specify/` or `specs/` exists -> use Spec Kit SDD.
- Ensure the project SDD directory is initialized before writing specifications.

## Steps
1. Reuse the assigned worktree and branch (including a shared batch branch). Only create <KEY>-<title-slug> when no work branch is assigned. Preserve existing work; never write on the default branch.
2. Select the SDD framework from {sdd_framework} argument, flag, or project detection:

   **If using OpenSpec SDD:**
   - Create change directory `openspec/changes/<KEY>-<title-slug>/`
   - Write `proposal.md` (problem, value, in/out scope)
   - Write `design.md` (technical decisions, rejected alternatives)
   - Write `tasks.md` (ordered implementation checklist)
   - Write `specs/<capability>/spec.md` (requirements with Given/When/Then)
   - Validate with `openspec validate <change-id> --strict`

   **If using Spec Kit SDD:**
   - Write `specs/<KEY>-<title-slug>/spec.md` (prioritised user stories, functional requirements, Given/When/Then)
   - Write `plan.md` (stack, architecture, data contracts, target files)
   - Write `tasks.md` (ordered implementation checklist with test plan)
   - Use `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks` if available.

## Do not
- Do not decide what the clarification left open. Mark it as open and say so.
- Do not describe implementation inside the behaviour file.
- Do not start implementing, even the easy part.

## Report
- The files written, with their paths.
- The work branch.
- Requirements that are still open, and what they block.
