# Adjust Existing Pull Request

Stage: implemented -> reviewed.

## Sectile task access
- Use the local Sectile agent's exposed task-management interface first for ticket reads, updates, comments, creation, and workflow results. Discover its actual tools or documented commands from the session/project context; do not invent an endpoint or launch another agent daemon as a substitute.
- Resolve the project against its repository, then verify the task's full ID and external URL. A bare key such as #47 can match another project's ticket. Use the full task ID for mutations and an explicit project ID for creation.
- If the local agent interface is unavailable or fails after a bounded attempt, use http://localhost:8090 as a temporary fallback. Record the missing capability or error, check for an existing bug in the same project, and register or update that bug when authorized. If reporting is unavailable or not authorized, preserve the report locally and state what remains pending. Do not bypass Sectile by writing directly to its database or remote tracker.
- For a managed run, submit only through its supplied result contract and let Sectile validate and synchronize the result. An active run without a usable completion contract is a reportable integration failure. Preserve the artifacts and report the blocked transition; do not cancel the activity, forge launch/completion status, or use another endpoint to evade result validation.
- This routing does not authorize mutations excluded by the skill or user request. Verify each mutation's response and report partial success explicitly.

## Session title
- As soon as the ticket is identified, and before doing the work, rename the current session to `<ticket ID> - <ticket title>`, for example `#47 - Remove the parallelism setting`. The ID and title stay the same for the whole run: only a leading status emoji is added or removed.
- The status emoji mirrors the run state the skill reports to Sectile, at the same moment and at no other. While the skill works the title carries none: the host already shows whether the session is running.
  - `❓` with report_waiting true, right before a question the skill cannot continue without, and when the skill stops with open questions for the owner. Remove it with report_waiting false, when the work resumes.
  - `✅` with finish_run completed, once the skill reached its goal.
  - `❌` with finish_run failed, when the skill stops on a failure or a blocker it cannot resolve.
- When the skill runs nested in pickup-issue or pickup-issues, do not rename the session: the outer skill owns the title and its status.
- This applies to every agent, not only Claude Code: use whatever session renaming capability the running agent exposes, be it a session title tool, a rename command or the host session API. Discover it from the session context instead of assuming a name.
- If no renaming capability is available, or a rename is refused or left unapproved, keep the current title and continue silently. It never blocks, delays or replaces the work of the skill. A host that cannot rename, such as a Sectile Desktop console, shows the same state from the Sectile calls themselves.

## Launched by Sectile
A run is launched by Sectile when the invocation supplies a launch runId or a result-file contract, or when the environment carries `SECTILE_RUN_ID` (read it with a plain shell command such as `printenv SECTILE_RUN_ID`). Sectile Desktop then already shows the ticket, the pull request, the next step and its own notifications, so the items marked "not when launched by Sectile" below are skipped: they would only repeat what Desktop shows.

## Session links
Not when launched by Sectile.
- Right after renaming the session, write one line in the conversation that links the ticket: `Ticket: [<ticket ID>](<external URL>)`, with the external URL Sectile returns for it. Skip the line when the ticket has no external URL.
- When the skill creates or finds a pull request or merge request, write one line: `PR: [<number>](<URL>)`. On a GitHub pull request, when the host can bind the session to a pull request (the Claude desktop app's PR binding tool, for example) and the session does not show it already, bind it too. Elsewhere, GitLab included, the line is the only link.
- When the skill runs nested in pickup-issue or pickup-issues, write neither line: the outer skill writes the ticket line, and the PR line once a stage returns with a new pull request.
- If the host cannot bind a pull request, or the binding is refused, keep the line and continue. Links never block, delay or replace the work of the skill.

## Session experience
These make the session read like a Sectile Desktop execution. Use whatever the host exposes for each (in the Claude desktop app: its sidebar group, chapter, pane and notification tools); when the host has no such capability, or a call is refused, skip that item silently. None of them ever blocks, delays or replaces the work of the skill.
- **Project group.** Right after the session links, file the current session under the sidebar group named after the Sectile project (`projectName` from get_project_context). Reuse an existing group with that exact name; create it only when none exists. Move only the current session.
- **Chapter.** When the skill starts in a session that already holds earlier work, mark a chapter titled after the skill and the ticket ID, for example `Clarify #47`. Do not mark one when the skill is the first thing the session does.
- **Changes.** When the skill ends after changing code, show the session's diff pane, provided it covers the worktree the skill worked in; otherwise name the worktree path in the reply instead.
- **Next step** (not when launched by Sectile). When the skill ends with `✅`, finish the reply with the next step, ready to copy, with the full task ID and the command name the skills were invoked under (`/sectile:<skill>` when installed as a plugin): review and merge the pull request, then `/handoff-issue <task ID>`. When it ends on `❓` or `❌`, the next step is what the owner has to answer or fix; say that instead.
- **Notification** (not when launched by Sectile). When the run reaches `❓`, `✅` or `❌`, send one desktop notification, under 200 characters, leading with what the owner has to do (for example `#47 waits for your answer: 2 product questions`). Send none for routine progress; the host drops it anyway when the owner is watching.
- When the skill runs nested in pickup-issue or pickup-issues, do none of the above: the outer skill owns the group, the chapters, the pane, the next step and the notifications.

## Status update
Wherever the skill runs, end every reply addressed to a person with this block, including the final report and a reply that stops on a question. Keep the three labels as written; write the items in the language of the conversation, and write "None" for an empty line. A headless run, with nobody to read it, writes none.

```markdown
### 📋 Status Update

- **Done**:
  - <what was done in this reply>
- **Remaining (Agent)**:
  - <what is left for the agent, or None>
- **Pending (User)**:
  - <what the user has to do or decide, or None>
```

When the skill runs nested in pickup-issue or pickup-issues, do not write the block: the outer skill writes one for the whole run.

## Goal
Hand a reviewer a branch that is already worth reading: the obvious problems
found and fixed, the risky parts pointed out, the test plan written down.

## Read first
- The full diff of the branch against the default branch. All of it, not the summary.
- The specification, to check that what was asked is what was built. When its files are ignored by
  Git (dropped artefacts), they are not in the diff: read them from the worktree, or from the
  clarification and specification reports on the ticket.
- The current remote default branch: fetch the remote and identify its configured
  default branch before reviewing or publishing.

## Steps
1. Verify a matching PR exists for the task repository and branch before changing files: open, or already merged by the human. Record its URL. If missing, stop and recover through the configured creation owner (specify or implement). Never create a PR during adjustment, and never push onto a merged PR — review the merged state and report it. Read available PR feedback; retrieval failure is a blocker, not absence of feedback.
   A task that changed several repositories (`$SECTILE_REPOSITORIES` role `changed`) has one PR per repository: verify, review, push and update each of them in its own worktree, the same way, and give every secondary repository's PR to `transition_stage` in `prUrls`.
   Fetch the remote (`git fetch origin`) and compare the work branch with the
   remote default branch (normally `origin/main`; use the repository's configured default when different).
   Integrate missing base commits before the final review: prefer rebase when the branch is private, or merge when
   repository policy or shared-branch state requires it. Resolve conflicts and do not continue until the working tree is clean.
2. Review the complete resulting diff against the specification for correctness, side effects, security, and edge cases with no test. Address actionable feedback and record dispositions. No human feedback is required.
3. Update documentation affected by the change. Fix what the review finds, now. A known defect belongs in the code, not in the
   description of the merge request.
4. Re-run build, static analysis and tests after integrating the default branch and on the final state.
5. Commit with a conventional message: type, scope, and why the change exists. Never force-add a
   specification artefact that Git ignores (`git add -f`): the project drops them on this workstation.
6. Push the branch and update the same existing merge request: summary, test plan, and the specific
   places where you want a reviewer's eyes.
   Run `git fetch origin`, then choose the push from the state of `origin/<branch>`:
   - `origin/<branch>` does not exist (first publication): run `git push -u origin <branch>`. Never force a branch the remote does not have.
   - `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<branch> HEAD` succeeds (fast-forward): run a plain `git push`.
   - Otherwise an authorized rebase rewrote published history: run `git push --force-with-lease`.
   If the push is refused because commits landed on `origin/<branch>` in between (stale lease or non-fast-forward), run `git fetch origin`,
   replay the local commits with `git rebase origin/<branch>` so the remote commits are kept (merge instead if the conflicts cannot be resolved safely),
   re-run the checks if new commits came in, and retry once with the same rule. If it is refused again, or for another cause
   (branch protection, permissions, authentication), stop, keep the work and report the blocker. Never run an unguarded `git push --force`.
7. Verify the same PR is open and contains the pushed final commit, update its description and check evidence, then mark it ready. If any check, feedback retrieval, push or readiness verification fails, preserve work and report the blocker. If the repository has no remote, stop.

## Do not
- Do not merge, do not approve, do not close the ticket. That is the user's call.
- Do not create a PR. Do not mark a PR ready on a red build. Report the failure instead.
- Do not complete adjustment on a branch known to be behind the remote default branch.

## Report
- What the review found, and which findings you fixed.
- The merge request URL, or why there is none.
- The test plan a reviewer can replay, as a checklist.

## Execution and ticket state
- **Managed Sectile run**: When the invocation supplies a result-file contract, follow it. Sectile validates the result and owns transitions and tracker reports. Do not also call stage/postback APIs or edit tracker labels.
- **Remote execution indicator (standalone only)**: Before doing work, call start_run with the full task primary key and skill name. If SECTILE_RUN_ID or a launch runId is supplied, reuse it. Keep the returned activity ID as runId. Nested skills reuse the outer run; only the owner finishes it. Call finish_run with taskKey, runId, status (completed, failed or canceled), and a note when the entire invocation ends, including errors or stopping for user input. Intermediate stage transitions do not finish an enclosing pickup run. Never start a run merely to read a task.
- **Waiting for the user (standalone only)**: Right before asking the user a question you cannot continue without, call report_waiting with taskKey, runId and waiting true, so the board and the owner's desktop show the run as waiting. Your next Sectile call ends the wait; call report_waiting with waiting false if you resume without one. A headless run is left unmarked, which the result says.
- **Standalone invocation**: Read live context with `get_task` and `get_project_context`. After verifying each completed step, invoke `transition_stage` with the task key, completed stage, structured report note and actual branch. Check the tool result for errors before continuing.
Transition implemented → reviewed only when this step is complete.
Include prUrl with the verified pull request URL, and prUrls with the pull request of every other repository the task changed.
A task holds an ordered set of pull requests, one or more per repository it changed, `prUrl` being its primary repository's current one. A pull request on a branch the task already used in that repository is a legitimate follow-up and is appended, even when the recorded one is merged; a pull request on an unrelated branch is refused, and its links are corrected from the task detail view rather than by forging evidence. A pull request opened outside a transition is recorded with `record_pull_request`, once per repository.
A task whose work changed no repository (a configuration made through an API, a review, a follow-up) has no pull request to give: pass `noRepositoryChange: true` to `transition_stage` instead of `prUrl`, and say in the note what was done instead. The server refuses the statement when the task records a pull request on its branch or a repository prepared with `prepare_repository_worktree`; then give those pull requests.
Use `add_comment` for an authorized ticket discussion update. Managed runs must not also invoke transition/comment tools for reports owned by Sectile. If MCP is unavailable, preserve work and report the pending transition; do not silently write to a different server or database.
Reuse the assigned worktree and actual branch. Never merge or delete remote objects. Keep work available for review and retry until confirmed handoff.
