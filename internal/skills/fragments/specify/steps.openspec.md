1. Reuse the assigned worktree and branch (including a shared batch branch). Only create <KEY>-<title-slug> when no work branch is assigned. Preserve existing work; never write on the default branch.
2. Select the SDD framework from {sdd_framework} argument, flag, or project detection:

   **If using OpenSpec SDD:**
   - Create change directory `openspec/changes/<KEY>-<title-slug>/`
   - Write `proposal.md` (problem, value, in/out scope)
   - Write `design.md` (technical decisions, rejected alternatives)
   - Write `tasks.md` (ordered implementation checklist)
   - Write `specs/<capability>/spec.md` (requirements with Given/When/Then)
   - Validate with `openspec validate <change-id> --strict`

   **If using Spec Kit SDD:**
   - Write `specs/<KEY>-<title-slug>/spec.md` (prioritised user stories, functional requirements, Given/When/Then)
   - Write `plan.md` (stack, architecture, data contracts, target files)
   - Write `tasks.md` (ordered implementation checklist with test plan)
   - Use `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks` if available.
3. Dropped artefacts: before committing the specification, run `git check-ignore -q` on one of its
   files (`specs/<KEY>-<title-slug>/spec.md` or `openspec/changes/<KEY>-<title-slug>/proposal.md`).
   When it succeeds, the project drops its specification artefacts on this workstation: write the
   files in the worktree, never commit them, never force them with `git add -f`, and put the
   requirements and the open points in the transition note, saying that the files stay local to the
   worktree. Open no pull request at this stage then, even when the project creates it after
   specification: say in the report that it is deferred to the implemented stage.

4. Optional stage publication: read `pushStageCommits` from `get_project_context`
   (or the supplied project configuration); missing or false means off. When true,
   after each stage commit push the actual assigned work branch with a plain push.
   Use `git push -u origin <branch>` on first publication and `git push origin <branch>`
   afterwards. Never force. Report a refused push and continue the stage; retain the
   commit for retry. Ignored artifacts are never committed or force-added, so writing
   them alone triggers no push. This setting does not replace required PR publication.
