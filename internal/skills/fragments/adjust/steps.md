1. Verify a matching PR exists for the task repository and branch before changing files: open, or already merged by the human. Record its URL. If missing, stop and recover through the configured creation owner (specify or implement). Never create a PR during adjustment, and never push onto a merged PR — review the merged state and report it. Read available PR feedback; retrieval failure is a blocker, not absence of feedback.
   A task that changed several repositories (`$SECTILE_REPOSITORIES` role `changed`) has one PR per repository: verify, review, push and update each of them in its own worktree, the same way.
   Fetch the remote (`git fetch origin`) and compare the work branch with the
   remote default branch (normally `origin/main`; use the repository's configured default when different).
   Integrate missing base commits before the final review: prefer rebase when the branch is private, or merge when
   repository policy or shared-branch state requires it. Resolve conflicts and do not continue until the working tree is clean.
2. Review the complete resulting diff against the specification for correctness, side effects, security, and edge cases with no test. Address actionable feedback and record dispositions. No human feedback is required.
3. Update documentation affected by the change. Fix what the review finds, now. A known defect belongs in the code, not in the
   description of the merge request.
4. Re-run build, static analysis and tests after integrating the default branch and on the final state.
5. Commit with a conventional message: type, scope, and why the change exists.
6. Push the branch and update the same existing merge request: summary, test plan, and the specific
   places where you want a reviewer's eyes.
   Run `git fetch origin`, then choose the push from the state of `origin/<branch>`:
   - `origin/<branch>` does not exist (first publication): run `git push -u origin <branch>`. Never force a branch the remote does not have.
   - `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<branch> HEAD` succeeds (fast-forward): run a plain `git push`.
   - Otherwise an authorized rebase rewrote published history: run `git push --force-with-lease`.
   If the push is refused because commits landed on `origin/<branch>` in between (stale lease or non-fast-forward), run `git fetch origin`,
   replay the local commits with `git rebase origin/<branch>` so the remote commits are kept (merge instead if the conflicts cannot be resolved safely),
   re-run the checks if new commits came in, and retry once with the same rule. If it is refused again, or for another cause
   (branch protection, permissions, authentication), stop, keep the work and report the blocker. Never run an unguarded `git push --force`.
7. Verify the same PR is open and contains the pushed final commit, update its description and check evidence, then mark it ready. If any check, feedback retrieval, push or readiness verification fails, preserve work and report the blocker. If the repository has no remote, stop.
