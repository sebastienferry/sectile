1. Re-read the assigned branch and worktree. If docs/clarifications/<n>.md already exists,
   this run continues an existing clarification into Round N. If not, this is Round 1.
2. In Round 1:
   a. Restate the request in two sentences, including what is out of scope.
   b. List ambiguities, worst first. Only list an ambiguity if two readings lead to different code.
   c. Name critical dependencies: other services, migrations, missing data, third-party limits.
   d. Resolve reversible technical choices using existing code and project conventions.
   e. Formulate essential product questions that alter acceptance criteria, with your recommended option.
   f. Write docs/clarifications/<n>.md, commit with docs(spec): clarify #<n> (round 1).
   g. Ask the questions (interactively in-session if the owner is present; as a ticket discussion
      comment via add_comment when unattended).
3. In Round N (follow-up after owner answers):
   a. Read the owner's answers from the interactive prompt or ticket comments via get_task.
   b. Append a dated section: "## Round N - answers from the owner (<date>)" to docs/clarifications/<n>.md.
   c. Explicitly record settled choices and any reversed prior assumptions.
   d. Address newly surfaced ambiguities or dependencies.
   e. Commit updates with docs(spec): clarify #<n> (round N).
   f. If follow-up product questions remain, ask them and stop without transitioning.
4. Exit condition:
   Rounds continue until the owner confirms that the clarification is satisfactory (or zero open
   product questions remain in unattended pickup). Never transition new → clarified while product
   questions remain open.
5. Persist the settled scope, decisions, and assumptions in the report before concluding.
