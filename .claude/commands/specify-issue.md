# Specify Issue (OpenSpec SDD)

Stage: clarified -> specified.

## TaskFlow task access
- Use the local TaskFlow agent's exposed task-management interface first for ticket reads, updates, comments, creation, and workflow results. Discover its actual tools or documented commands from the session/project context; do not invent an endpoint or launch another agent daemon as a substitute.
- Resolve the project against its repository, then verify the task's full ID and external URL. A bare key such as #47 can match another project's ticket. Use the full task ID for mutations and an explicit project ID for creation.
- If the local agent interface is unavailable or fails after a bounded attempt, use http://localhost:8090 as a temporary fallback. Record the missing capability or error, check for an existing bug in the same project, and register or update that bug when authorized. If reporting is unavailable or not authorized, preserve the report locally and state what remains pending. Do not bypass TaskFlow by writing directly to its database or remote tracker.
- For a managed run, submit only through its supplied result contract and let TaskFlow validate and synchronize the result. An active run without a usable completion contract is a reportable integration failure. Preserve the artifacts and report the blocked transition; do not cancel the activity, forge launch/completion status, or use another endpoint to evade result validation.
- This routing does not authorize mutations excluded by the skill or user request. Verify each mutation's response and report partial success explicitly.

## Goal
Produce a specification another engineer could implement without asking you
anything. Behaviour and acceptance criteria first, implementation choices second,
and the two kept in separate files.

## Read first
- Project-configured SDD framework: openspec. Use it unless the invocation explicitly overrides it.
- The clarification outcome on the ticket: the decisions are already made, apply them.
- Select the SDD framework in order: explicit {sdd_framework} or --framework=<name>,
  then the project-configured framework, then repository detection:
  - If `openspec/` exists -> use OpenSpec SDD.
  - If `.specify/` or `specs/` exists -> use Spec Kit SDD.
- Ensure the project SDD directory is initialized before writing specifications.

## Steps
1. Reuse the assigned worktree and branch (including a shared batch branch). Only create <KEY>-<title-slug> when no work branch is assigned. Preserve existing work; never write on the default branch.
2. Select the SDD framework from {sdd_framework} argument, flag, or project detection:

   **If using OpenSpec SDD:**
   - Create change directory `openspec/changes/<KEY>-<title-slug>/`
   - Write `proposal.md` (problem, value, in/out scope)
   - Write `design.md` (technical decisions, rejected alternatives)
   - Write `tasks.md` (ordered implementation checklist)
   - Write `specs/<capability>/spec.md` (requirements with Given/When/Then)
   - Validate with `openspec validate <change-id> --strict`

   **If using Spec Kit SDD:**
   - Write `specs/<KEY>-<title-slug>/spec.md` (prioritised user stories, functional requirements, Given/When/Then)
   - Write `plan.md` (stack, architecture, data contracts, target files)
   - Write `tasks.md` (ordered implementation checklist with test plan)
   - Use `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks` if available.

## Do not
- Do not decide what the clarification left open. Mark it as open and say so.
- Do not describe implementation inside the behaviour file.
- Do not start implementing, even the easy part.

## Report
- The files written, with their paths.
- The work branch.
- Requirements that are still open, and what they block.

## Execution and ticket state
- **Managed TaskFlow run**: When the invocation supplies a result-file contract, follow it. TaskFlow validates the result and owns transitions and tracker reports. Do not also call stage/postback APIs or edit tracker labels.
- **Remote execution indicator (standalone only)**: Before doing work, call taskflow_start_run with the full task primary key and skill name. If TASKFLOW_RUN_ID or a launch runId is supplied, reuse it. Keep the returned activity ID as runId. Nested skills reuse the outer run; only the owner finishes it. Call taskflow_finish_run with taskKey, runId, status (completed, failed or canceled), and a note when the entire invocation ends, including errors or stopping for user input. Intermediate stage transitions do not finish an enclosing pickup run. A batch tracks each task separately. Never start a run merely to read a task.
- **Standalone invocation**: Read live context with `taskflow_get_task` and `taskflow_get_project_context`. After verifying each completed step, invoke `taskflow_transition_stage` with the task key, completed stage, structured report note and actual branch. Check the tool result for errors before continuing.
Transition clarified → specified only when this step is complete.
Use `taskflow_add_comment` for an authorized ticket discussion update. Managed runs must not also invoke transition/comment tools for reports owned by TaskFlow. If MCP is unavailable, preserve work and report the pending transition; do not silently write to a different server or database.
Reuse the assigned worktree and actual branch. Never merge or delete remote objects. Keep work available for review and retry until confirmed handoff.

## Project pull request policy
PR creation stage: specified. Read this setting from taskflow_get_project_context before executing. After the specification is written and validated, commit and push the specification on the task branch and open a draft PR/MR for specification review. Reuse an existing PR/MR for that branch. Include its URL as prUrl in the specified transition. Keep newly created PRs draft while implementing; preserve an existing ready PR; update the same PR/MR and mark it ready only after implementation and review. Do not mark the task reviewed merely because a draft exists.
