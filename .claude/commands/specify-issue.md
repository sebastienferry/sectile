# Specify Issue (OpenSpec SDD)

Stage: clarified -> specified.

## Goal
Produce a specification another engineer could implement without asking you
anything. Behaviour and acceptance criteria first, implementation choices second,
and the two kept in separate files.

## Read first
- Project-configured SDD framework: openspec. Use it unless the invocation explicitly overrides it.
- The clarification outcome on the ticket: the decisions are already made, apply them.
- Select the SDD framework in order: explicit {sdd_framework} or --framework=<name>,
  then the project-configured framework, then repository detection:
  - If `openspec/` exists -> use OpenSpec SDD.
  - If `.specify/` or `specs/` exists -> use Spec Kit SDD.
- Ensure the project SDD directory is initialized before writing specifications.

## Steps
1. Reuse the assigned worktree and branch (including a shared batch branch). Only create <KEY>-<title-slug> when no work branch is assigned. Preserve existing work; never write on the default branch.
2. Select the SDD framework from {sdd_framework} argument, flag, or project detection:

   **If using OpenSpec SDD:**
   - Create change directory `openspec/changes/<KEY>-<title-slug>/`
   - Write `proposal.md` (problem, value, in/out scope)
   - Write `design.md` (technical decisions, rejected alternatives)
   - Write `tasks.md` (ordered implementation checklist)
   - Write `specs/<capability>/spec.md` (requirements with Given/When/Then)
   - Validate with `openspec validate <change-id> --strict`

   **If using Spec Kit SDD:**
   - Write `specs/<KEY>-<title-slug>/spec.md` (prioritised user stories, functional requirements, Given/When/Then)
   - Write `plan.md` (stack, architecture, data contracts, target files)
   - Write `tasks.md` (ordered implementation checklist with test plan)
   - Use `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks` if available.

## Do not
- Do not decide what the clarification left open. Mark it as open and say so.
- Do not describe implementation inside the behaviour file.
- Do not start implementing, even the easy part.

## Report
- The files written, with their paths.
- The work branch.
- Requirements that are still open, and what they block.

## Execution and ticket state
- **Managed TaskFlow run**: When the invocation supplies a result-file contract, follow it. TaskFlow validates the result and owns transitions and tracker reports. Do not also call stage/postback APIs or edit tracker labels.
- **Remote execution indicator (standalone only)**: Before doing work, call taskflow_start_run with the full task primary key and skill name. If TASKFLOW_RUN_ID or a launch runId is supplied, reuse it. Keep the returned activity ID as runId. Nested skills reuse the outer run; only the owner finishes it. Call taskflow_finish_run with taskKey, runId, status (completed, failed or canceled), and a note when the entire invocation ends, including errors or stopping for user input. Intermediate stage transitions do not finish an enclosing pickup run. A batch tracks each task separately. Never start a run merely to read a task.
- **Standalone invocation**: Read live context with `taskflow_get_task` and `taskflow_get_project_context`. After verifying each completed step, invoke `taskflow_transition_stage` with the task key, completed stage, structured report note and actual branch. Check the tool result for errors before continuing.
Transition clarified → specified only when this step is complete.
Use `taskflow_add_comment` for an authorized ticket discussion update. Managed runs must not also invoke transition/comment tools for reports owned by TaskFlow. If MCP is unavailable, preserve work and report the pending transition; do not silently write to a different server or database.
Reuse the assigned worktree and actual branch. Never merge or delete remote objects. Keep work available for review and retry until confirmed handoff.

## Project pull request policy
PR creation stage: implemented. Read this setting from taskflow_get_project_context before executing. Create the PR/MR after implementation and review, reusing any existing PR/MR for the task branch. Do not create one during specification.
